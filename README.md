# Sentiment-Classifier
In this project, I applied knowledge that I've learned from The Coursera course -  Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries - to program a Sentiment Analysis
that requires extracting fake Twitter Data from a CVS file and writing it onto another CVS file that will consist of having the number of negative and positive 
words to put a judgment on whether it's a positive or a negative tweet. A representation of the results was also done on ScatterPlot to visualize it.
